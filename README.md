# Learning In Motion - Co-op posting Scrapper

This here is a simple Python script that will gather job postings from the University of Victoria's Job Bullin board on Learning in Motion. This script will break if they decide to make major changes to the source code, but I doubt it. Although in that case, the script will need to be updated.  

In the future, I hope to implement features such as:
- Filtering new postings with old ones.
- Searching for key words.
- Submit applications via gui.
- Anything else I can think of.

Feel free to modify this as you wish. Currently, I am facing issues with pyinstaller so the only way to run this is to pass it through an interpreter or IDE like VS code and run it manually. Linux users can make this script into an exe by "chmod +x app.py" and be done with it.
